The site itself is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static HTML and CSS website generator. Many of the old blog posts were exported from an ancient wordpress site.

To run the site, you must [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#chocolatey-windows) using something like `choco install hugo -confirm`. Once installed, you can use the command `hugo server`.
