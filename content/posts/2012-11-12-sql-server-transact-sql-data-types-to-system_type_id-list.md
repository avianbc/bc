I received metadata for a SQL Server 2008 R2 database which contained the system\_type\_id but not the data type itself. I ran a bunch of queries and logged the results to obtain a list of system\_type\_ids and the corresponding datatypes.

I looked on MSDN and was unable to find a list so I compiled one for usage for you google-ninjas who may find it handy.
