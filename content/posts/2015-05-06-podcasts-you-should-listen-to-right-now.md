  * [This Developer&#8217;s Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) &#8211; Podcast in the style of This American Life dealing with programming related topics. An all time favorite of mine.

  * [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) &#8211; The best podcast ever? Short, well produced episodes dealing with design.
  * [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/) &#8211; TED Talks are a must.
  * [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) &#8211; The best production of any podcast ever made. Interesting and seemingly random discussions.
  * [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) &#8211; I think this has been cited as the most popular podcast ever until [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) came along&#8230; which was also created by them.
  * [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) &#8211; Random things relating to the internet are discussed. Gimlet Media is worth paying attention to as every podcast they release is solid gold.
  * [Startup](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) &#8211; A podcast documenting company creation from brainstorming, soliciting investors, creating a startup, running it, and more. Interesting look at something not normally public.
  * [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/radio/) &#8211; Economists can be interesting too.
  * [You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/) &#8211; Self delusion&#8230; and cookies?
